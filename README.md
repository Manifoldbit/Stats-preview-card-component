- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was able to learn "mix-blend-mode" and "opacity" property in css inorder to blend the color on the picture background.

I also learnt that padding and margin are to use "rem" as the unit

I learnt how to use the google font family 


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
  opacity: 0.7;
  margin: 2rem 5rem;
  padding: 5rem 2rem;
}
```
### Continued development

Im still currently learning how to use min-max height or width;
